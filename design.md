# **Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python**<br/>by **Mary van Valkenburg**

Specs deadline: YYYY-MM-DD

*Please read the [course design process description](http://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/)
and complete these steps in the `README.md` file in your course repository.
If you need assistance,
please speak with your Curriculum Lead.*

## Step 1: Brainstorming

### What problem(s) will students learn how to solve?

### What techniques or concepts will students learn?

### What technologies, packages, or functions will students use?

### What terms or jargon will you define?

### What analogies or heuristics will you use?

### What mistakes or misconceptions do you expect?

### What datasets will you use?

## Step 2: Who Is This Course for?

Which of [these four learners](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/personas.html)
is your course intended to help, and how?

* Student 1: discussion.
* Student 2: discussion.
* Student 3: discussion.

## Step 3: What Will Learners Do Along the Way?

Write full descriptions of a couple of significant exercises to show how far learners are likely to get.

### Full Exercise 1

Describe the exercise here in full, including the concepts taught, the starter code, and any other important details.

**Solution**

```
Include the code that you expect the students to write mid-way through the course.
It should typically be 3-10 lines.
```

### Full Exercise 2

Describe the exercise here in full, including the concepts taught, the starter code, and any other important details.

**Solution**

```
Include the code that you expect the students to write by the end of the course.
It should typically be 3-10 lines.
```

### Other Exercises

Write brief point-form descriptions of 10 to 15 more exercises spaced throughout the course,
and include the full solution to each
(so that we can see how fast you think learners will go,
and so that we can check the code runs properly).

#### Exercise title 1

- Describe the exercise.
- Mention the learning objectives.
- Two or three bullets points is enough.

**Solution**

```
Solution code here.
It should typically be 3-10 lines.
```

#### Exercise title 2

- Describe the exercise.
- â€¦

**Solution**

```
Solution code here.
```

## Step 4: How Are the Concepts Connected?

*Remind yourself about [course terminology](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design#terminology-and-structure), then describe the flow of the course.*

- Chapter 1
  - Lesson 1.1
  - Lesson 1.2
  - Lesson 1.3
- Chapter 2
  - Lesson 2.1
  - Lesson 2.2
  - Lesson 2.3

The datasets are:

- `datasets/dataset-1`: data set 1
- `datasets/dataset-2`: data set 2

## Step 5: Course Overview

We will work on this together as the last step before handing your course off to the Content Development team.
